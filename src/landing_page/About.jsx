            <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">At PeerSkills, we believe that everyone has something valuable to offer. Whether you're a designer, a developer, a musician, or a home chef â€” your skills can help someone grow, just as theirs can help you.

Our platform is built to connect people who are passionate about learning and teaching. No money involved â€” just meaningful exchanges of time, knowledge, and passion.

In a world that moves fast, we slow down to make learning personal again. Weâ€™re not just building a platform â€” weâ€™re building a community where skills are the new currency.</p>

    ðŸ§© What Makes Us Different
    
    </h3>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
Unlike traditional learning platforms, PeerSkills doesnâ€™t charge users or rely on formal credentials. We believe real skills come from real people, and learning should feel like a conversation â€” not a transaction.

Here, your passion is your currency. Whether youâ€™re great at photography or just starting out in coding, you have something valuable to share.
